As I write this blog, I sit in my room in my parent’s house, on the last day of the year. I have finished college and am back for a month before I leave for my internship in another new city. I will be leaving on the evening of 1st January. The end of today will not just signify the end of the year; it will mean the end of a phase for me. For me, 31st December, 2025 marks the end of the trial phase of adulthood. Tonight, when the clock strikes 12, when people start celebrating and fireworks cover the sky, I will say a little prayer of gratitude. I will express gratitude for everything good and bad that happened since I left for college. For my family being in good health. For all the people I met, all the people I stopped talking to, and all the people I still call when I feel like letting it all out.

In my fourth semester of college, I was a very stressed student. I was overwhelmed by coursework and by the immense feeling of being left behind. Everyone I looked up to in college was doing something they were passionate about—making high-level abstract coding projects, investing money in stock markets, working for a healthy body in the gym, etc. All I was doing was keeping up with what the college asked of me, and I felt that I was being left behind by people who did not confine themselves to the mold that the world made for them. This was not in terms of an academic metric, but in terms of real-life experiences. I felt I wasn’t building anything I could use in the real world. I feared what would happen if my achievements within the protected bubble of academic institutions were to fail me on the harsh roads of modern society. So dejected by the difference in capabilities, I started. I started a chase, running behind validation and, more than anything, self-satisfaction. But the feeling that what I was doing was good enough never seemed to reach me. Everything I thought of doing, made a plan of doing, and all that I actually did seemed to pale in comparison to the people against whom I was competing.

At the same time, I was going through an identity crisis. In my personal life, I had forced the locus of my emotions onto someone else, making the actions of that person responsible for how I spent my day. I had let go of what defined me and my moods. For the entirety of my fifth and sixth semesters, I was ruining moments and experiences for the both of us. Combining both of these emotional overdrives, my mind lost its ability to quiet down. Every action that any other person committed, every pause that they took, and every expression that they showed meant something. My mind traced every little tone change to an action I took.

It wasn’t until my seventh semester, after various emotionally distressing situations, after I had put myself to sleep even though my brain refused to shut down, that I truly understood what I was doing. With the beginning of the seventh semester, the college degree beginning to wind itself up, I was forced to face the reality that the person I had forced so much responsibility for my social experiences on would eventually move to a different place and might not feel the need to remain in contact with me. In the face of that realization, I came to understand that though everything will be different, I will still go on. I will continue to try to look for the kind of companionship I wanted, and maybe now I will start with a kind of boundary. With this acceptance of things being much more simple than they seemed to appear, also came the gratitude.

I looked back at the 18-year-old boy who lived in a small town no one had heard of, who was nervous about taking public transport in the big city, who relied on others to take decisions because he wanted to cause as little inconvenience as possible, and who wore his constant availability like a badge of honour. Today, that boy had learned to say no. He learned that he might be someone who lived by how the world expected him to, but at the same time, he defied its expectations. He knew now that he too was different, that his lack of eccentricity was accompanied by his need to be the best. He knew now that he too had grown.

With this, the anxiety caused by constant comparison settled down, leaving behind the other forms of anxiety that still plague me. Though everything isn’t solved now, I do understand that everything will never be solved. There will always be some problem or the other. There will always be someone who will be expecting things; there will always be someone who will use a particular tone that will trigger my need to be the responsible “good” child. I just have to learn to find moments of happiness and peace between all these crises.

With all these lessons to remember and the nights I spent crying over the past now forgotten, I look ahead. I wish all of you a very Happy New Year. I hope we don’t repeat the same mistakes we made in the previous years, but let’s be honest—we all know we will just find new ones. After all, what is human experience without mistakes to remember, right?
